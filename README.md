Singly Linked List Data Structure

![alt tag](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/gq/2013/03/Linkedlist.png)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Javascript, Node, Jest

Implemented Singly Linked List using node and jest for testing.

## Lessons Learned:

Linked list have a time complexity of O(1) which trumps the array data structure with a time complexity of O(n). We would use Linked Lists to save time, but also to add elements easier to the beginning of the array. Downside is that if I'm not operating on the first element it would be O(n) as I have to go through each elements to get the element desired. With LinkedList it's much easier to access and manipulate at the beginning element while in an array it's easier to access and manipulate elements in the middle.
